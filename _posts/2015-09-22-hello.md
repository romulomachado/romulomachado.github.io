I heard the phrase "you should be blogging" a couple of times in the last few months. Finally, I found some time to update the website (let me know if you see something behaving weirdly) and set up the blog.

My goal is to share whatever is in my mind at the moment. Most of the posts will be technical, but I won't hesitate to write about other things. I promise I'll do my best to post here frequently.

For the technical part, expect to find a lot of Ruby (Rails, Middleman, Sinatra) and Ember.js content here, I've been hacking on them a lot lately. Since the web is in constant evolution and new things come out every week, I'll, hopefully, share my experiments with new and exciting things too.

If that's your cup of tea, this site is built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, it is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> and the source code is <a href="https://github.com/romulomachado/romulomachado.github.io" target="_blank">here</a> if you want to take a look at.

See you in the next one!
